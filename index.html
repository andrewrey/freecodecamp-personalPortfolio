            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>Over the life of my working career I've worked in several postions. Originally I was trained a a Pilot, moved on to being an English teacher in Japan and Vancouver and then on to Secure Logistics where I held both road and operations positions.</p>
            <p>In 2015 I got a lucky break to be part of a tech startup in Vancouver Canada working as president of operations. In this position I had to build a team of engineers to produce a SDK allowing for item tracking using Bluetooth.</p>
            <p>
              With having very little knowledge of the tech space, I had to get myself up to speed on everything tech for our project. This included understanding how Bluetooth operated as well as understanding both Swift and Java as our SDK ran on both Apple and Android devices. Through the
              experience of managing a development team, I started to want to be a developer myself. I found out something about myself I didn't know. I never thought myself capable to learn to coding, let alone make an application.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was able to place the startup in a tech accelorator called PlugandPlay in Sunnyvale California, where I met with executives from several large tech companies. Through this experience I knew that I wanted earn my place there as a developer. Last October 2019 I decided to make a
              significant career change and self-study full time to become a developer, and so starts my journey. I hope you enjoy seeing my projects here, these are my starting point in making my dream happen.
